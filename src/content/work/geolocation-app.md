### About

This was private freelance work. The company requested an application that could interact with their electronic tracking device. The app had to determine the current device location on a map and track where the device had been. The app would use this information to notify the user if the device leaves a predetermined geographical area.

### My role

I worked with the engineering team to write a code for an IoT device to communicate with a location tracking application. This required knowledge of AWS, Arduino, STM32 boards and React.

#### Skills

Redux, Jest, Enzyme, API Calls, Firebase, Git and basics of Arduino, STM32 and AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C.
