### About

Yell works closely with their clients to understand their individual specifications, their market and how they want their brand to be represented online. Their experts help the customers to ensure that their site contains engaging content and is optimised to maximise the return on their marketing.

### My role

At Yell, the focus was on making sure the end product was both exciting and detailed while meeting objectives quickly. During the design process, they ensured a balance between quality and speedy delivery. Additionally, as part of the team, they participated in various stages of development, launch, and maintenance.

Working at Yell gave them the chance to blend design and coding skills. Some debate whether designers should code, but they found value in being able to create and test their interface designs using code. This not only benefited them personally but also helped their team.

#### Skills

Web-design, Adobe family, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and SCSS.
