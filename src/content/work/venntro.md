### My role

During 2017, I worked on various dating websites at Ventro. My focus was on making the websites easy to use, helpful, accessible to all users, and appealing to keep them coming back for a positive experience. I concentrated on usability, utility, accessibility, and desirability to enhance the functionality and appearance of these sites. Let's dive in!
